# Discount Calculator
This is a small function written in Python to apply discounts to prices. It was done for demonstrative purposes, to showcase my current knowledge of Unit Testing using the pytest library.

## Instructions
If you want to try it, you can simply import the file discount_calculator_2.py to your current Python shell environment. The function has a docstring attached to consult how to input the required arguments.

Obviously, if you want to Unit Test it, you'll need to download the pytest library.
