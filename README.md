# Discount Calculator
This is a small function written in Python to apply discounts to prices. It was done for demonstrative purposes, to showcase my current knowledge of Unit Testing using the pytest library.

## Instructions
It's pretty straightforward. Press Code (green button) and download the zip. Open the file discount_calculator_input.ipynb using a Jupyter Notebook and follow instructions there. 

## Trivia

The function was originally released on my [Sololearn profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/13506786) on December 2019. You can try this first version [here](https://code.sololearn.com/cK6Lt85j1X6l/#py).
