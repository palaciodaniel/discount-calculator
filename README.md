# Discount Calculator
This is a small function written in Python to apply discounts to prices. It was done for demonstrative purposes, to showcase my current knowledge of Unit Testing using the pytest library, along with GitHub's TravisCI and codecov apps.

You can run it by simply clicking the **Launch Binder** icon above and wait a few seconds until it is loaded. If you never used a Jupyter Notebook before, go to the **Cell** tab on the menu, press **Run All** and enter your input on the bottom cell. If you want to repeat the operation, just click that last cell and press the **Run** icon below 'Cell'.

## Trivia

The function was originally released on my [Sololearn profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/13506786) on December 2019. You can try this first version [here](https://code.sololearn.com/cK6Lt85j1X6l/#py).
